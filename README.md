# House Price Prediction Project

This project aims to develop an end-to-end machine learning solution for predicting house prices based on various features such as housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, and ocean proximity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10
- Anaconda or Miniconda (optional)

### Setup
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Create a new virtual environment:
    ```bash
    conda create -p venv python=3.10
    conda activate venv
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run any of the scripts in the `pipeline` directory to initiate the training or prediction process.

## Usage
- `train_pipeline.py`: This script initiates the training pipeline, which includes data ingestion, data transformation, model training, and model evaluation.
- `prediction_pipeline.py`: This script initiates the prediction pipeline, where users can input new data to get predictions on house prices.
